UITableView Header Grouped By Date
==================================

Very basic example using CoreData to group the UITableView Section Header's with the NSDate

*Note* There is a bug in this and I'll fix it when I get time, if you fix it before me then email me
and I'll get it so you can commit the fix.

Tom Curley did the fix - Thanks Tom! 

Might be useful to someone.
